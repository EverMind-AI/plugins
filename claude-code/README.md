# EverOS Claude Code Plugin

Persistent, cross-session memory for **Claude Code**, backed by a self-hosted
[EverOS](https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverOS) — with nothing to call and
nothing to remember to do.

The plugin recalls relevant memories **before every prompt** and injects them as
context, saves **every finished turn** — text plus the full tool-call trajectory
— and **seals the session** when it ends or before context compaction. You just
work.

Good to know:

- **Fail-open by design.** If EverOS is down or unreachable, Claude Code behaves
  exactly as it does without the plugin. Memory pauses; nothing breaks.
- **Local only.** Your transcripts go to your own EverOS on loopback and nowhere
  else.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — native `fetch`, no npm install.
- Memory is **partitioned per repository**, and every worktree of a repository
  shares one partition.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Node | ≥ 20, on `PATH` (the hooks run `node`) |
| EverOS | ≥ 1.3.0, initialised (`everos init`) with the `api_key` fields filled in `~/.everos/everos.toml` |
| Claude Code | a version with plugin support (`claude plugin --help` works) |

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add EverMind-AI/Plugins
claude plugin install everos@everos --scope user
```

Enabling the plugin asks two questions. Both can be answered with Enter:

- **EverOS base URL** — `http://127.0.0.1:8000` unless you moved it.
- **EverOS checkout directory** — leave empty unless `everos` is not on your
  `PATH` (see [Running from a checkout](#running-from-a-checkout)).

To update later:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update everos
claude plugin update everos@everos
```

Setting up EverOS from scratch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverOS.git
cd EverOS
uv sync
uv run everos init      # writes ~/.everos/everos.toml — REQUIRED before first start
# edit ~/.everos/everos.toml — fill in the api_key fields (llm / embedding / rerank)
uv run everos server start
```

## First run

The plugin checks EverOS at session start and, if it is down and the address is
loopback, starts one for you. You may see one of these lines:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(nothing)* | EverOS was already running. This is the normal case. |
| `⚡ EverOS started — memory is on.` | The plugin started one and it answered. |
| `⏳ EverOS is starting in the background…` | Started, but slower than the 5s wait. Memory resumes on its own. |
| `⚠️ EverOS could not be started (…)` | The start command failed. Run `/everos:status`. |
| `⚠️ EverOS unreachable at …` | Down, and not startable from here. Run `/everos:status`. |

**A server the plugin starts keeps running after Claude Code exits.** A hook is a
two-second process, so there is nobody left to own the server; it is detached on
purpose. Stop it when you want to:

```bash
pkill -f "everos server start"
```

Starting Claude Code in several windows is safe. EverOS holds a single-instance
lock, so the second attempt exits and the first serves everyone.

## Verify it works

Three checks. **Confirm each one against the files on disk** — a session that
merely seems to remember proves nothing while it is still open, because the
context it is answering from is its own.

**1. It remembers you across sessions.**

```text
My favourite coffee is espresso.
```

Wait a few seconds (extraction is asynchronous), then `/clear`, and ask:

```text
What coffee do I like?
```

Receipt: `~/.everos/claude-code/<repo>/users/<you>/episodes/` contains a
markdown file mentioning espresso.

**2. It remembers project decisions.** In a repository, agree on something —
"use ruff, not black in this project" — then start a new session, in that
repository or any worktree of it, and ask for a lint step. The decision should
be in the recalled context.

Receipt: the `🧠 EverOS: …` line appears above the reply, and
`~/.everos/claude-code/<repo>/agents/claude-code/.cases/` fills up once a turn
has enough tool calls to be worth recording.

**3. It fails open.** Stop EverOS (`pkill -f "everos server start"`) and keep
working. Exactly one warning line appears per session, Claude Code answers
normally, and no hook error is shown.

## How memory is partitioned

One EverOS serves every host. Your Claude Code memory is separated from
OpenClaw's and Hermes's by `app_id`, and from your other repositories by
`project_id`.

| EverOS field | Value | How it is chosen |
|---|---|---|
| `app_id` | `claude-code` | Fixed. |
| `project_id` | host, owner and repository | `git config --get remote.origin.url` → the last three segments joined, e.g. `github.com_EverMind-AI_Plugins`; else the git toplevel directory name; else the directory name. Override with `EVEROS_CC_PROJECT_ID`. |
| `user_id` | your OS user | `$USER`, `$USERNAME`, then the OS account. Override with `EVEROS_CC_USER_ID`. |
| `agent_id` | `claude-code` | Fixed. |

The remote comes first so that worktrees of one repository (`repo`, `repo-a`,
`repo-b`) share one memory rather than three, and every clone URL of a
repository — ssh, https, with or without `.git` — resolves to the same id.

Host and owner are part of it because a bare repository name is not a
namespace: two `api` repositories from different owners are ordinary, and
under a bare name they would read each other's decisions.

On disk:

```
~/.everos/claude-code/<project_id>/users/<user_id>/     episodes, atomic facts, profile
~/.everos/claude-code/<project_id>/agents/claude-code/  cases, skills
```

**Want one memory across all your projects?** Set `EVEROS_CC_PROJECT_ID` to a
fixed value. Everything then lands in one partition.

## Configuration

Precedence: **environment variable** > **plugin option** (what the install
prompt asked, stored in `~/.claude/settings.json`) > **default**. A blank or
whitespace-only value counts as unset and never shadows a lower layer.

| Variable | Plugin option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EVEROS_CC_BASE_URL` | `base_url` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | EverOS address. A missing scheme is filled in; an unparseable value falls back to the default. |
| `EVEROS_CC_EVEROS_DIR` | `everos_dir` | unset | Working directory for the start command. |
| `EVEROS_CC_START_CMD` | — | `everos server start` | Quote-aware; e.g. `uv run everos server start`. |
| `EVEROS_CC_USER_ID` | — | your OS user | Identity for personal memory. |
| `EVEROS_CC_PROJECT_ID` | — | derived | Force one partition. |
| `EVEROS_CC_RECALL_TIMEOUT_MS` | — | `5000` | Budget for the two recall searches. Clamped to 500–7000; resolving the project id spends up to 2 s of the hook's 10 s before this starts. |
| `EVEROS_CC_VERBOSE` | — | off | Also print "no relevant memory" and "saved N messages". |
| `EVEROS_CC_DEBUG` | — | off | Write hook diagnostics to `debug.log` in the data directory. |
| `EVEROS_CC_DATA_DIR` | — | `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, else `~/.everos/.claude-code` | Where per-session state, `debug.log` and `everos-server.log` live. |

A warm search takes 0.3–0.8 s, so the recall budget is almost never spent; it
exists for the tail. Raise it if `/everos:status` shows a slow server, lower it
if you would rather never wait.

### Running from a checkout

When `everos` is not on your `PATH` — the usual case with a `uv` project —
point the plugin at your checkout:

```bash
export EVEROS_CC_EVEROS_DIR="$HOME/EverOS"
export EVEROS_CC_START_CMD="uv run everos server start"
```

Claude Code launched from a GUI inherits no shell environment. Put values that
must always apply in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env`, or answer the plugin
option prompt for `base_url` and `everos_dir`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/everos:status` | Server health, the identity used for capture and recall, effective configuration with the layer each value came from, and the last few errors. Start here whenever memory seems missing. |
| `/everos:search <query>` | Runs the same two-track search the recall hook runs, with the same ids, and prints the block verbatim — so what you see is exactly what a prompt would have been given. |

## What is captured, and what is not

**Captured**, once per finished turn:

- your prompt, with any memory block the plugin itself injected stripped out
- the assistant's text
- every tool call, as OpenAI-shaped `tool_calls` (name and arguments)
- every tool result, paired to its call

The full trajectory is sent on purpose: EverOS's case extractor needs the tool
rounds to recognise a reusable approach, and it does its own trimming. A single
tool result longer than 20 000 characters is head-and-tail truncated first, as a
payload-size guard.

**Not captured**: thinking blocks; subagent (Task tool) traffic; skill bodies,
slash-command scaffolding and other host-injected text that is not something you
typed; images and other attachments.

## Troubleshooting

**Start with `/everos:status`.** It names the first missing setup step.

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| Nothing is ever recalled | Extraction is asynchronous — a conversation from seconds ago is not indexed yet. Then check `project_id` in `/everos:status`: memory from a different repository is not visible here. |
| No `🧠 EverOS` line, no warning either | The prompt was skipped: memory is not searched for slash commands or prompts under three words. |
| Cases never appear under `agents/` | EverOS rejects trajectories with no detour and a single user message. Cases come from real multi-turn work, not from one-shot questions. |
| Hooks appear to do nothing at all | `node` is not on the `PATH` Claude Code was launched with. Check with `/everos:status`; if that also fails to run, that is the cause. |
| `SessionEnd hook … Hook cancelled` | The host cancelled the seal on exit; routine under `claude -p`. The next session seals it, so nothing is lost. |
| Recall times out | Raise `EVEROS_CC_RECALL_TIMEOUT_MS`. Also check `/everos:status` for a large index queue. |

Logs live in the data directory (`/everos:status` prints the path):
`debug.log` (set `EVEROS_CC_DEBUG=1` first) and `everos-server.log` for a server
the plugin started.

## Privacy

Everything stays on your machine. The plugin talks to `base_url` and to nothing
else, and it sends what you would expect: your prompts, the assistant's replies,
and tool calls with their results.

**Tool results are part of that.** If a command prints a secret, that secret
reaches EverOS. EverOS has no authentication of its own, so keep `base_url` on
loopback unless you have secured it yourself. The plugin never starts a server
for a non-loopback address, and if `base_url` points at another machine it says
so once per session, naming the host.

## Development

```bash
cd claude-code
npm test                          # node:test, no dependencies
claude plugin validate . --strict
./scripts/e2e.sh                  # end-to-end against a REAL EverOS
```

`scripts/e2e.sh` drives the four hooks exactly as Claude Code would, against a
running EverOS, and verifies by backend receipt — markdown on disk and a real
search — rather than by asking a chat whether it remembers. It needs LLM
credentials, so it is not part of CI. Point it elsewhere with
`EVEROS_CC_BASE_URL` and `EVEROS_ROOT` (the server's `--root`).
